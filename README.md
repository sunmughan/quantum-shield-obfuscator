# 🔐 Ultimate Multi-Language Code Obfuscation Engine

**MILITARY-GRADE PROTECTION** - The most advanced code obfuscation engine that makes your applications virtually unbreakable. Supports JavaScript, PHP, Dart, and Kotlin with enterprise-level security features.

## 🚀 Why This Engine is Unbreakable

### 🛡️ Military-Grade Security Features
- **14-Layer Protection System** with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Advanced Anti-Debugging** with real-time detection
- **VM/Sandbox Detection** prevents analysis in virtual environments  
- **Self-Destruct Mechanism** on tampering attempts
- **Runtime Integrity Monitoring** with automatic violation response
- **Domain Locking** restricts execution to authorized domains
- **Time-Based Expiration** for trial and licensed software
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation** with 500,000+ iterations

### 🎯 Advanced Obfuscation Techniques
- **Control Flow Flattening** converts linear code to complex switch structures
- **String Encryption** with individual AES keys per string
- **Variable Name Randomization** with cryptographic entropy
- **Dead Code Injection** confuses reverse engineering tools
- **Token Shuffling** maintains functionality while hiding structure
- **Final Code Encryption** with secure runtime loaders

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support
- ✅ **JavaScript** (React, Node.js, Vue.js, vanilla JS)
- ✅ **PHP** (Laravel, vanilla PHP)
- ✅ **Dart** (Flutter applications)
- ✅ **Kotlin** (Android, JVM applications)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone "https://github.com/sunmughan/quantum-shield-obfuscator.git"
cd quantum-shield-obfuscator
npm install

# Make CLI globally available
npm install -g .
```

## Additional Dependencies to Install:
```
npm install crypto worker_threads os
```
The obfuscator should now work without errors and provide significantly enhanced protection with all the recommended improvements implemented properly.
